# 🛡️ Hypervisor Source Safety Database

> Community-driven malware analysis of hypervisor sources circulating on hacking forums.  
> **Goal:** Help users verify if source code they downloaded is safe before running or compiling it.

## ✅ SAFE

### AFOP.B1-HypervisorSources

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **File** | `AFOP.B1-HypervisorSources.7z` |
| **Unpacked Size** | ~89.7 MB |
| **Date Analyzed** | February 28, 2026 |
| **Verdict** | ✅ **SAFE** |
| **Analyst** | Claude, Codex |

**Contents analyzed:**
- `HypervisorIntelSource/` — HyperDbg-based Intel hypervisor source
- `HypervisorAMDSource/` — SimpleSvm-based AMD hypervisor source

**Checks performed:**
- Static code analysis (all source files)
- Build script review (`CMakeLists.txt`, `.clang-format`)
- Dependency audit (`/dependencies`, `/libraries`)
- Scan for hardcoded IPs, C2 callbacks, obfuscated payloads
- Scan for rootkit patterns (SSDT hooks, DKOM, hidden driver installation)
- Scan for persistence mechanisms (registry run keys, scheduled tasks, service install)
- Scan for data exfiltration (network calls, file system reads of sensitive paths)
- Scan for credential harvesting or keylogger routines
- Scan for embedded binary blobs or shellcode in source

**Findings:** No malicious, suspicious, or dangerous code patterns detected. Source code is consistent with a legitimate open-source hypervisor/debugger project. Codebase matches expected structure for HyperDbg and SimpleSvm derivatives.

## 🔬 Analysis Methodology

All sources are analyzed using the following approach:

1. **Static analysis** — Full review of all source files for malicious patterns
2. **Build script audit** — Check for scripts that download or execute external content
3. **Dependency check** — Review third-party libraries for known malicious code
4. **Indicator scan** — Search for hardcoded IPs, URLs, obfuscated strings, shellcode
5. **Rootkit pattern scan** — Check for kernel hooks, DKOM, privilege escalation, persistence
6. **Network behavior review** — Identify any unexpected outbound communication logic

Tools used: Ghidra, x64dbg, Wireshark (dynamic), manual code review (static)
