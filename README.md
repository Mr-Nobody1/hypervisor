# 🛡️ Hypervisor Source Safety Database

> Community-driven malware analysis of hypervisor and game-cheat sources circulating on hacking forums.  
> **Goal:** Help users verify if source code they downloaded is safe before running or compiling it.

## ✅ SAFE

### AFOP.B1-HypervisorSources

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **File** | `AFOP.B1-HypervisorSources.7z` |
| **Unpacked Size** | ~89.7 MB |
| **Date Analyzed** | February 28, 2026 |
| **Verdict** | ✅ **SAFE** |
| **Analyst** | Antigravity |

**Contents analyzed:**
- `HypervisorIntelSource/` — HyperDbg-based Intel hypervisor source
- `HypervisorAMDSource/` — SimpleSvm-based AMD hypervisor source

**Checks performed (Phase 0–8 Audit):**
- Static code analysis — all source files scanned (10 detection categories)
- Build script & supply chain review (`CMakeLists.txt`, `.vcxproj`, `.ps1`)
- Pre-compiled binary audit (`.obj`, `.lib` files verified against upstream Zydis/Zycore)
- Dependency integrity verification (Zydis, Keystone, ia32-doc, pdbex)
- Code provenance — matched against upstream HyperDbg and SimpleSvm repositories
- Scan for rootkit patterns (SSDT hooks, DKOM, hidden driver installation)
- Scan for hypervisor-specific threats (EPT weaponization, VMCALL backdoors, MSR abuse)
- Scan for process injection APIs (`CreateRemoteThread`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`)
- Scan for credential harvesting and keylogger routines
- Scan for persistence mechanisms (registry run keys, scheduled tasks, service install)
- Scan for data exfiltration (network calls, file system reads of sensitive paths)
- Scan for obfuscated payloads, shellcode arrays, and encoded blobs
- VM-exit handler review — all exit reason cases verified as legitimate
- Architecture verification — all suspicious hypervisor behaviors justified

**Findings:** No malicious, suspicious, or dangerous code patterns detected. Source code is consistent with a legitimate open-source hypervisor/debugger project. Codebase matches expected structure for HyperDbg and SimpleSvm derivatives.

## 🔬 Analysis Methodology

All sources are analyzed using a **comprehensive 8-phase audit framework**. See the full methodology: **[methodology.md](methodology.md)**

### Audit Phases:

| Phase | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Initial Triage** | Archive hashing, file inventory, binary artifact count, git history check |
| 1 | **Code Provenance** | Upstream identification, recursive diff against known projects, deviation mapping |
| 2 | **Build System & Supply Chain** | Build script audit, pre-compiled binary verification, dependency integrity |
| 3 | **Static Source Code Analysis** | 10-category automated pattern scan + manual deep review of critical functions |
| 4 | **Assembly Review** | Targeted review of `.asm` files for shellcode, raw syscalls, self-modifying code |
| 5 | **Resource & Data Audit** | `.rc`, `.inf`, `.reg`, `.dat`, `.bin` file inspection and entropy analysis |
| 6 | **Dynamic Analysis** | Sandboxed execution with Procmon, Wireshark, and WinDbg monitoring |
| 7 | **Architecture Verification** | Legitimacy assessment of inherently suspicious hypervisor behaviors |
| 8 | **Final Verdict** | 10-question checklist determining SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / DANGEROUS rating |

### Detection Categories (Phase 3):

| ID | Category | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| A | Process Injection APIs | CRITICAL |
| B | Credential Harvesting & Keylogging | CRITICAL |
| C | Rootkit / Kernel Hooks | HIGH |
| D | Hypervisor-Specific Threats (MSR, EPT, VMCALL) | HIGH |
| E | Interrupt & Exception Hijacking | HIGH |
| F | Anti-Analysis / Evasion | MEDIUM |
| G | Networking & Exfiltration | MEDIUM |
| H | Privilege Escalation | MEDIUM |
| I | Persistence Mechanisms | MEDIUM |
| J | Obfuscation & Encoded Payloads | HIGH |

### Tools used:
`ripgrep`, `Ghidra`, `x64dbg`, `WinDbg`, `Wireshark`, `Procmon`, `strings`, `7-Zip`, manual code review, PowerShell automated scanning

## 📝 How to Analyze a New Source

1. **Download and extract** the source archive in an isolated environment.
2. **Copy** [`reports/TEMPLATE.md`](reports/TEMPLATE.md) to `reports/SAFE/` or `reports/DANGEROUS/` with a descriptive filename.
3. **Follow the 8-phase methodology** in [`methodology.md`](methodology.md), filling in each section of the template.
4. **Determine the verdict** using the Phase 8 checklist.
5. **Add an entry** to the Safety Database table in this README.
6. **Commit and push** the report.
